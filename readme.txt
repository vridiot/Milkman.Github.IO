Ripped by Guy

Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3DS

Please note that some areas may have been edited to restore them to their original appearance (normally props) due to the way they're exported from the ripping program.

Textures may be missing as well (ex: animated textures such as water?), as not all textures are exported from ripping program either.
